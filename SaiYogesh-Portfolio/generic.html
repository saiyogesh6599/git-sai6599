								<h2>Professional Summary</h2>
								<p>With over 4+ years of experience as a Java Full Stack Developer, I specialize in designing, developing, and deploying scalable web and cloud-based applications. My expertise spans a wide range of technologies, including Java/J2EE, Spring Boot, Hibernate, Microservices architecture, and front-end frameworks like Angular and React. I have a proven track record of delivering high-quality solutions while following Agile/SCRUM methodologies and adhering to best practices in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and Test-Driven Development (TDD).</p>
								<p>I am certified as an AWS Developer Associate, a Certified Kubernetes Administrator, and a Certified Java Developer from Coding Shuttle. These certifications demonstrate my proficiency in cloud services, container orchestration, and Java-based application development, enabling me to deliver efficient, scalable, and secure solutions for complex business challenges.</p>
								<p>Throughout my career, I have worked on impactful projects, including the development of 5G network services for over 15.8 million users in Japan, leveraging Microservices, Spring Boot, and AWS. Additionally, I contributed to the UberX 2 project, where I implemented advanced ride-fetching strategies to optimize system performance and user experience. My work on API management using Apigee further highlights my expertise in API development and deployment.

									My technical skillset includes languages like Java, Python, and JavaScript, frameworks such as Spring Boot, Hibernate, and Node.js, and cloud platforms like AWS. I am proficient in tools such as Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, and Git, which I use to streamline CI/CD pipelines and ensure efficient deployments. My database experience spans both RDBMS (Oracle, MySQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB) systems, allowing me to handle a variety of data storage needs.
									
									Professionally, I have excelled in roles at Rakuten Symphony and Innoeye Technologies, where I contributed to building microservices-based applications, deploying Dockerized solutions, and creating dynamic front-end interfaces. My strong problem-solving skills, attention to detail, and passion for leveraging technology to drive innovation make me a valuable asset to any organization.</p>
